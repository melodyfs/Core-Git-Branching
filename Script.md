## Plot

Leon woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.

A man glanced at him and walked away.

After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally Leon would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Leon’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Leon had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Leon would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.


Leon met the Unicorn King who pretended to grant him magic powers. What Leon was not expected, was that the King inserted a drop of devil's blood into his body. The Unicorn King was not sane after all. He wished to manipulate Leon and turn the world into chaos. The King, would remain pure and powerful in front of the world.

Zookeeper yelled, "This is the best kingdom to live!" Zookeeper decides to stop Leon from obtaining the power from the King. He poisoned Leon with a witch's eyes.


The end.
